<center><small>The super fantastic way of getting Gravatars. By [The Poacher](http://thelincolnshirepoacher.com).</small></center>

In less than a minute you can add Gravatars to your Ruby project. It works in Rails, Merb & Sinatra.

The best way to learn more about Gravtastic is to [look through the annotated source](http://chrislloyd.github.com/gravtastic). It's one file, about 80 LOC and really pretty simple. If that isn't for you, then follow the instructions below!


## Install

    sudo gem install gravtastic


## Usage

For this example I'm going to assume you are using Rails. Don't worry if you arn't, the concepts are still the same.

First off, add this to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'gravtastic'

Next, in your model:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Gravtastic
      gravtastic
    end

<small>_Note: You can use either `is_gravtastic!`, `is_gravtastic` or `has_gravatar`, they all do the same thing._</small>

And you are done! In your views you can now use the `#gravatar_url` method on instances of `User`:

    <%= image_tag @user.gravatar_url %>

Gravatar gives you some options. You can use them like this:

    <%= image_tag @user.gravatar_url(:rating => 'R', :secure => true) %>

That will show R rated Gravatars over a secure connection. If you find yourself using the same options over and over again, you can set the Gravatar defaults. In your model, just change the `is_gravtastic` line to something like this:

    gravtastic :secure => true,
                  :filetype => :gif,
                  :size => 120

Now all your Gravatars will come from a secure connection, be a GIF and be 120x120px.

Gravatar needs an email address to find the person's avatar. By default, Gravtastic calls the `#email` method to find this. You can customise this.

    gravtastic :author_email

### Defaults

A common question is "how do I detect wether the user has an avatar or not?" People usually write code to perform a HTTP request to Gravatar to see wether the gravatar exists. This is certainly a solution, but not a very good one. If you have page where you show 50 users, the client will have to wait for 50 HTTP requests before they even get the page. Slooww.

The best way to do this is to set the `:default` option when using `#gravatr_url`. If the user doesn't have an avatar, Gravatar essentially redirects to the "default" url you provide.

### Complete List of Options

<table width="100%">
  <thead>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Values<th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>secure</b></td>
    <td>Gravatar transmitted with SSL</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>true/false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>size</b></td>
    <td>The size of the image</td>
    <td>80</td>
    <td>1..512</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>default</b></td>
    <td>The default avatar image</td>
    <td><i>none</i></td>
    <td>"identicon", "monsterid", "wavatar" or an absolute URL.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>rating</b></td>
    <td>The highest level of ratings you want to allow</td>
    <td>G</td>
    <td>G, PG, R or X</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>filetype</b></td>
    <td>The filetype of the image</td>
    <td>png</td>
    <td>gif, jpg or png</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Other ORMs

Gravatar is really just simple Ruby. There is no special magic which ties it to one ORM (like ActiveRecord or MongoMapper). You can use the following pattern to include it anywhere:

    require 'gravtastic'
    class MyClass
      include Gravtastic
      is_gravtastic
    end

For instance, with the excellent [MongoMapper](http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper) you can use do this:

    class Person
      include MongoMapper::Document
      include Gravtastic

      is_gravtastic

      key :email
    end

And wallah! It's exactly the same as with ActiveRecord! Now all instances of the `Person` class will have `#gravatar_url` methods.

_Note: the `#gravatar_url` methods don't get included until you specify the class `is_gravtastic!`_


## Making Changes Yourself

Gravtastic is a mature project. There isn't any active work which needs to be done on it, but I do continue to maintain it. Just don't expect same day fixes. If you find something that needs fixing, the best way to contribute is to fork the repo and submit a pull request.

    git clone git://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic.git
