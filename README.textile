Easily add "Gravatars":http://gravatar.com to your Ruby objects.


h2. Install

  sudo gem install chrislloyd-gravtastic --source=http://gems.github.com


h2. Usage

Somewhere in your application you need to @require 'gravtastic'@. In Rails >= 2.1 you can forego this and just add a dependency gem dependency for Gravtastic.

    config.gem 'gravtastic', :source => 'http://gems.github.com/'

The next step is to give your model a Gravatar:

  class User
    has_gravatar
  end

If you are using a standard Ruby class or Datamapper resource you have to add the line @include Gravtastic::Model@ before @has_gravatar@.
  
This defaults to looking for the gravatar ID on the @email@ method. So, if your @User@ has an @email@ then it will send that to Gravatar to get their picture. You can change the default gravatar source like this:

  has_gravatar :on => :author_email

Now, you can access your object's gravatar with the @gravatar_url@ method:

  current_user.gravatar_url
  => "http://www.gravatar.com/e9e719b44653a9300e1567f09f6b2e9e?r=PG"

Note that it defaults to a PG rating. You can specify extra options with a hash:

  current_user.gravatar_url(:rating => 'R18', :size => 512)
  => "http://www.gravatar.com/e9e719b44653a9300e1567f09f6b2e9e?r=PG&s=512"

PS.  Bonus points for anybody who can tell me what that users email is!
PPS. Shame on Auttomatic for still using MD5!


h2. The Future

It isn't auto-included in ActiveRecord and Datamapper classes. When I fix this it means that you won't have to do the whole @include Gravtastic::Model@ thing for your models. You'll still, however, have to do that for standard Ruby classes.

And lastly, the RDoc sucks, so that needs to be included.
